# decimalToBinaryConverter
Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. This can reduce a complex problem into simpler sub-problems, until they become straightforward to solve.

In this project, I built a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. I learned the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack, and built out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation.
